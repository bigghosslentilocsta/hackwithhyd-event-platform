Sakura - A Next-Generation Event Platform üå∏
Submission for the HackWithHyderabad Hackathon | Problem Statement #6

Welcome to the official repository for Sakura, a feature-rich and beautifully designed prototype for a next-generation event management platform. This project was built to address the challenge of creating a more engaging, collaborative, and user-centric platform for hackathons, conferences, and other tech events.

üöÄ Key Features of the Prototype
Our prototype is a fully functional full-stack application that goes beyond a basic proof-of-concept. We focused on building a stable, polished, and impressive Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with several advanced features.

üé® 1. Beautiful & Intuitive UI/UX
Custom "Sakura Day" Theme: A unique, light, and airy theme with a custom color palette, modern typography, and a stunning animated background of falling sakura petals.

Polished Interface: The application includes smooth fade-in animations, gradient buttons with hover effects, and a card "focus" effect on the dashboard to create a dynamic and professional user experience.

Professional Notifications: All system messages are delivered through non-intrusive "toast" notifications.

ü§ñ 2. AI-Powered Team Finder
To solve the core "AI" challenge, we built a smart recommendation engine. Users enter their skills during registration, and the "Team Finder" page suggests potential teammates by matching them with others who share common skills.

üí¨ 3. Real-Time, Persistent Live Chat
The standout technical feature of the project. Each event has its own dedicated details page featuring a live chat room.

Real-Time: Users can communicate instantly with other event participants.

Persistent: All chat messages are saved to the database, so the entire conversation history is loaded every time a user revisits the event page.

üë• 4. Social & Engagement Features
Join/Leave Event System: Users can join and leave events, with the UI intelligently showing the correct button ("Join Event" or "Leave Event").

Live Participant Count: The dashboard displays the number of participants who have joined each event in real-time.

"See Who's Going": Users can view a list of all participants for any event.

üîç 5. Live Search & Filtering
The main dashboard includes a live search bar that filters the list of events in real-time as the user types, demonstrating a polished and user-friendly design.

üîÆ Vision for the Complete Project
This prototype is a strong foundation. The vision for the complete project is to expand it into a full-featured, market-leading platform that serves not just participants, but event organizers as well.

The next major phase of development would focus on building a Comprehensive Organizer Portal, which would include:

Detailed Event Creation: A step-by-step wizard for organizers to create events with custom branding (banners, logos), detailed timelines, prize information, and rules.

Analytics Dashboard: A powerful dashboard for organizers to track key metrics like registration numbers, user engagement over time, and participant demographics.

Sponsor Management: Tools to showcase event sponsors and manage sponsorship tiers.

Seamless Integrations: The ability to connect with third-party services like Google Calendar, Slack for notifications, and payment gateways for ticketed events.

By adding this second layer, "Sakura" would become a complete ecosystem for the entire tech event community.
